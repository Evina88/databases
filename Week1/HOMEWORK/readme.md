Exercise 1: Create and insert queries

Wrote a JavaScript file (to be executed with Node.js) that creates and makes a connection to a MySQL database,
using the mysql package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql).

 Inside JavaScript file, made queries that:

Create a database called company
Make a connection to your database, using your MySQL hyfuser login credentials
Create a table called Employees with the following fields (emp_no, emp_name, salary and reports_to).
Create a table called Departments with the following fields (dept_no, dept_name and manager)
Create a table called Projects with the following fields (proj_no, proj_name, starting_date, ending_date)

I inserted the data through MySQL Workbench though in order to familiarize with it
